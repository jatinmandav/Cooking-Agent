Easy to Make Dosa ( South Indian Pancakes ) 	3 cups rice|1 cup urad daal ( split , skinless black gram )|3 / 4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds|Salt ( to taste )|Vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil	Gather the ingredients . Wash the rice and urad daal well . Add the fenugreek seeds to the mix and fill enough water in the rice - daal bowl to cover them about 2 - inch deep . Soak overnight . The next morning , drain all the water from the rice and urad daal . Now put some in a food processor and grind—adding very little water if necessary—to a smooth yet slightly grainy paste . When all the rice - daal mix is ground like this , put it into a large mixing bowl and add enough water to make a batter . The consistency of the batter should be such that it thickly coats a spoon dipped in it . Now add salt to taste and keep the dosa batter aside in a warm , dark spot , covered , for 6 to 8 hours . After this fermentation , stir the batter well . It is now ready to make dosas . Put some cooking oil in a small bowl and keep ready . You will also need a bowl of ice cold water , a large , flat nonstick pan , 2 sheets of paper towel , a ladle , a spatula , and a basting brush . Fold one sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip lightly into the bowl of cooking oil . Squeeze out any excess and then rub the paper towel all over the surface of the pan to grease . The correct amount of oil is such that it is barely visible in the pan . Now turn on the heat / flame at medium high . Fill the ladle up to the 3 / 4 level with dosa batter . Gently pour this batter onto the center of the pan—just as you would for a pancake—till the ladle is empty . Now begin to spread the batter in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8 - inch diameter . Do not be alarmed if the dosa develops tiny holes as you spread the batter . This is normal . As soon as you have finished spreading the batter out on the pan , dip the basting brush in cooking oil and drizzle the oil all over the surface of the dosa and also around its edges . Now hold the pan by its handle , lift up and swirl it so as to make the drizzled oil spread all over the dosa . When the upper surface begins to look cooked ( it will no longer look soft or runny ) , flip the dosa . By this time , ideally , the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color . Cook for 1 minute after flipping . The dosa is almost done . Fold it in half and allow to cook for 30 seconds more . Before you start making the next dosa , fold another sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip it in ice cold water . Squeeze the wad to remove excess water and then rub it all over the surface of the pan to cool it slightly . This ensures your next dosa will spread evenly and not break because the pan is too hot . Now proceed as you did for the last dosa . Serve the ready dosa with side dishes like South Indian coconut chutney , South Indian gunpowder chutney , and sambar .

In a large bowl , mix the powdered milk , flour , and baking powder well . Add a little of the thickened cream at a time and knead to make a dough that is medium - soft but not sticky . You do not need to use all the cream , just enough to reach the desired consistency ; the smoother it is , the better . Once the dough is ready , divide it into walnut - sized balls and roll between lightly greased palms until smooth . Any cracks that show up get worse later and could lead to the "" milk balls "" cracking as they are fried . This is not desirable , so take all the time you need for this step in order to get it right . While you are making the balls , heat the oil for deep frying in a wide pan on low to medium heat . Fry the dumplings , stirring often to brown on all sides . Do not cook on very high heat as the dumplings will burn on the outside and remain raw inside . Once cooked , drain with a slotted spoon while removing the dumplings from the oil and transfer immediately into the rose syrup . Repeat this until all the dumplings are cooked and in the syrup . Allow the dumplings to soak in the syrup for at least 2 hours before serving . "

An Easy Recipe for Adrak Ki Chai - Ginger Tea	1 cup water|1 cup milk ( whole )|3 teaspoons tea leaves|1 - inch piece ginger|Sugar to taste	To make adrak ki chai tea , you ' ll first mix the milk and water in a deep pan and bring them to a boil on a high flame .

Then , allow the mixture to rise and turn off the flame . You don ' t want to sacrifice taste here . Go for strong teas like Assam , Darjeeling , Nilgiri or Ceylon for the best flavor . If these teas aren ' t readily available at your local grocery store , try ordering them online from specialty tea merchants . After heating the mixture , you ' ll cover the tea and allow it to brew for two minutes . Filter through a strainer . Then , add whatever amount of sugar suits your taste . You can also use a sugar substitute , such as honey or agave .

The correct amount of oil is such that it is barely visible in the pan . Now turn on the heat / flame at medium high . Fill the ladle up to the 3 / 4 level with dosa batter . Gently pour this batter onto the center of the pan—just as you would for a pancake—till the ladle is empty . Now begin to spread the batter in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8 - inch diameter . Do not be alarmed if the dosa develops tiny holes as you spread the batter . This is normal . As soon as you have finished spreading the batter out on the pan , dip the basting brush in cooking oil and drizzle the oil all over the surface of the dosa and also around its edges . Now hold the pan by its handle , lift up and swirl it so as to make the drizzled oil spread all over the dosa . When the upper surface begins to look cooked ( it will no longer look soft or runny ) , flip the dosa . By this time , ideally , the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color . Cook for 1 minute after flipping . The dosa is almost done . Fold it in half and allow to cook for 30 seconds more . Before you start making the next dosa , fold another sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip it in ice cold water . Squeeze the wad to remove excess water and then rub it all over the surface of the pan to cool it slightly . This ensures your next dosa will spread evenly and not break because the pan is too hot . Now proceed as you did for the last dosa . Serve the ready dosa with side dishes like South Indian coconut chutney , South Indian gunpowder chutney , and sambar .

Now slowly add a little of the very cold water at a time , making a dough . Knead until you have a medium - firm dough . Keep aside to rest while you prepare the filling . To make the filling , first set up a pan to heat on medium . Now add the 1 tablespoon vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil and heat . When hot , add the cumin seeds and saut until the spluttering stops . When this happens , add the pre - soaked moong dal , coriander powder , ginger paste , garlic paste , dry red chili flakes , dried raw mango powder / aamchoor and salt to taste . Stir to mix well .

Very lightly flour a clean , flat surface and knead the dough you made earlier , again . Divide it into 12 equal - sized portions . Take one portion and flatten it into a circle that is 3 inches to 4 inches wide . The edges should be thicker than the center . Now spoon a tablespoon - full of the cool filling into the center of the circle . Begin to gather up the edges in a pleating / pinching motion so that soon you will have made a small bag / purse with the filling closed inside , like a dumpling . Flatten this bag / purse and keep aside . Do the same for the remaining portions of dough until all are used up . Let rest for three to five minutes while the vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil for deep frying heats up . To heat the oil for deep - frying , put it into a deep wok and set up on medium heat . You know the oil is ready for deep frying the Kachoris when a tiny ball of dough , dropped into it , will sizzle and rise slowly to the surface . If the ball does not rise , the oil is still cold . If it rises immediately , the oil is too hot . The temperature of the oil is critical to turning out good , true khasta kachoris , so watch it carefully ! While the oil is heating , take one filled kachori at a time and use the heel of your palm to flatten into a circle 3 inches to 4 inches wide on a very lightly floured surface . Press the edges slightly more than the center so that they are thinner . Do this for all the filled kachoris . They are now ready to fry when the oil is hot enough . When the oil is ready , drop one to two kachoris at a time to fry . Do not overcrowd the wok . Use a slotted spoon and when the kachori has fried on one side for two to three minutes turn to see if it is golden . If it is , this side is done . Now allow the other side to fry until golden too . When this happens , drain the khasta kachoris with the slotted spoon , remove and place on kitchen towels to drain further . To serve , when slightly cooler poke a hole in the center of one side of a Khasta Kachori with your index finger and pour in some tamarind chutney and mint - coriander chutney . Accompany with a steaming cup of masala chai sit back , relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor !

Add the cornflour , red chili powder ( if using ) , onion , green chilies , curry leaves and chopped coriander and mix thoroughly so that the chicken pieces are fully coated . Meanwhile , in a Dutch oven or medium pot , heat the oil for deep - frying . You will know the oil is hot when you drop in a piece of chicken and the oil sizzles and the chicken slowly comes to the surface . Add a few pieces of chicken , coated with the marinade , at a time . Fry until golden on all sides . Use a slotted spoon to gently turn every now and then . When golden , remove the chicken pakoras from the oil with a slotted spoon , draining the oil , and rest on paper towels to remove even more oil . Serve piping hot with raita and a steaming cup of masala chai .

Moong Daal Ka Vada Fritters Recipe	1 and a 1 / 2 cup split Moong Daal , skin still on ( this is what helps the Mangodis crisp up ! )|8 - 10 cloves of garlic|3 - inch piece of ginger|2 green chillies ( or less if you want less heat )|Pinch of Asafetida|Salt to taste|Optional : 1 / 2 to 1 tsp of red chilli powder|1 tsp coriander powder|1 tsp of fennel seeds|1 / 2 cup green coriander leaves ( finely chopped , fresh )|1 tbsp Chaat Masala	Put the Moong Daal ( this is a picture of whole Moong Daal with skin on . In our recipe , we are using this same daal , just split with skin left on . You can buy it this way at any good Indian store . ) in a bowl or sieve and wash under running water until the water runs clear . Put the washed Moong Daal into a large deep bowl and add enough warm water to cover the Moong fully . Leave overnight to soak . The Moong Daal will have soaked up water and softened and expanded by the next morning . The next morning , drain as much of the water away as you can . Now use a food processor to grind together the Moong Daal you soaked overnight , along with the garlic , ginger , green chilies , asafoetida , salt to taste , red chili powder and coriander powder . Do not add any water at first . The aim is to get the batter as thick as we can . The trick to doing this ( or let’s just say my trick to doing this ) is to add no water at first and run the food processor for 5 seconds . This will give you an idea of whether you need to add water . If you do , add it very little at a time and only as much as necessary to get a very thick , medium fine - coarse batter . All is not lost if you have added too much water and your batter is runny ! Simply add some Bengal gram flour / Besan to thicken it . This is not ideal but helps save the day . Once your batter is ready , set up enough of the vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil to heat for deep frying . I like to use a wok and do this on medium heat . Too hot and the oil will burn the Mangodis and not hot enough means you will end up with Mangodis in which the inside is still raw both disaster scenarios ! I am just kidding , but yes , less than perfect . To the ground Moong Daal paste , add the fennel seeds and the finely chopped , fresh green coriander leaves . Mix thoroughly with a spoon or clean hands . The vendors I observed carefully in Lajpat Nagar Market in Delhi , used their hands and ‘whisk’ the batter to fill it up with air so that their Mangodis are light and fluffy . I daresay the same can be done with a wooden spoon : - ) Your batter is now ready ! Hopefully , the oil is hot too , and you are ready to fry the Mangodis . To test if the oil is ready , take a small amount of the Mangodi batter and drop it into the hot oil . If it races up to the surface and turns dark brown , the oil is too hot . If it floats up to the surface slowly and does not burn , the oil is just right . When your oil is ready and the right temperature , use a teaspoon to scoop up and drop small balls of the batter into the hot oil . Do this repeatedly until you have a fair few Mongodis frying in the oil . Do not overcrowd the oil so that the Mangodis are touching as they will stick together if you do this . Use a slotted spoon to very gently turn the Mangodis occasionally so that they brown evenly . They are done when they start to turn a deep golden brown . When ready , remove the Mangodis from the oil with the slotted spoon and put on a kitchen towel for the excess oil drain off . Sprinkle VERY lightly with Chaat Masala and serve with a bowl of Mint - Coriander Chutney and Tamarind Chutney and a cup of steaming Adrak Ki Chai !

Fish Amritsari	1 kilogram fish ( any fish with firm , white flesh ) cut into medium - thick slices|3 tablespoons ginger paste|3 tablespoons garlic paste|1 teaspoon turmeric powder|1 teaspoon coriander powder|1 teaspoon cumin powder|1 teaspoon carom seeds ( ajwain )|1 teaspoon chili powder|Dash salt to taste|2 tablespoons lime juice ( juice of 1 lime )|1 1 / 2 cups Bengal gram flour|Oil to shallow fry fish|Juice of 1 lemon|1 lime ( wedged )	Mix all the ingredients except the fish and lime wedges , in a large , shallow dish . Form a thick paste . Gently fold the fish into this paste , making sure to coat each piece well . Allow to marinate for 1 hour .

Besan Ki Roti ( Bengal Gram Flour Flatbread ) 	1 cup whole wheat flour|1 cup Bengal Gram flour / Besan|1 cup all - purpose flour|Water ( yogurt or milk yields super soft Besan Ki Rotis )|Dash salt ( or to taste )|2 tbsp . vegetable oil ( or canola / sunflower cooking oil )	"Put all flours and salt into a deep mixing bowl . Stir well to mix them all together . Take out about 5 to 6 tablespoons and set aside on a plate for when you roll out the Rotis . Make a well in the center of the flour in your mixing bowl . Pour a tiny bit of water into the well and begin to mix the flour into it . Go slow with the water and add it only as needed . The idea is to wet the flour only enough to get it to start binding together into a dough . As the dough begins to come together , knead firmly to knock out any lumps . Adding oil at this stage is optional ; it makes for a very smooth dough and soft Besan Ki Rotis . The finished dough must be smooth and medium to soft in consistency . After it is done , cover and set it aside for 10 to 15 minutes to rest . Divide the dough into approximately 18 to 20 equal portions , roughly the size of a golf ball . Roll between your palms , applying gentle pressure , until the balls are smooth and without cracks . Make as many as you need and keep ready to roll out . Lightly flour a smooth , clean , and dry surface using some of the flour you set aside earlier . Coat one ball in this flour . Doing this will prevent the ball from sticking to the rolling surface . Flatten the ball of dough with your fingers to get it ready to roll ! Roll with circular motions till you have a 4 "" circle . Lightly coat the circle on both sides to prevent the dough from sticking as you roll the Besan Ki Roti . The size of the fully rolled Besan Ki Roti should be roughly 6 to 7 inches . This is not a fixed size . The rolled out Besan Ki Roti must not be too thin or it will not puff when roasted , so stop rolling when the Besan Ki Roti has reached 1 / 6 inch thick , no matter what the size . Heat a pan on a medium flame and put the rolled out Besan Ki Roti on it to cook . The Besan Ki Roti is ready for its first flip when you begin to see raised bumps on its surface . Use a spatula to turn it on to its other side . The side that was facing down ( and is now up ) will have light brown spots all over it . Keep checking the other side and do the second flip when it looks similar to the first side . Wait 10 seconds ( approximately ) after the second flip and then use a folded kitchen towel to gently press the Besan Ki Roti around its edges . This will encourage it to puff out . Once puffed up , the Besan Ki Roti is done . Now remove it from the pan and serve immediately or store in a container . The steam that caused the Besan Ki Roti to balloon will release soon after it is removed from the fire , so line the container with a kitchen towel to keep the Besan Ki Roti warm , soft , and free from moisture . Get started on the next one and keep going until you have used up all the dough . "
Mathri Savory Indian Crackers Recipe	2 cups / 250 gm / 8 . 8 oz all purpose flour|1 / 2 cup / 83 . 5 gms or 2 . 9 oz of semolina|5 tbsps vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil|1 tsp salt|1 tbsp coarsely ground black pepper|1 tbsp Kasuri Methi|150 ml warm water|Sunflower oil ( or other cooking oil ) for deep frying	"Put all the ingredients ( except the oil for deep frying ) into a large bowl ( I prefer using a stand mixer as it is faster ) . Mix well and then knead till you get a firm , smooth dough . If you are using a stand mixer , you will need to take the dough out and knead it by hand for a bit to get a smooth dough . Once the dough is well kneaded , divide it into 4 - 5 equal portions and then further divide each portion into 10 equal parts . Roll each part into a ball . Lightly dust your rolling surface with flour and use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a rough circle shape ( these need not be perfect ! ) about 3 - 4 mm in thickness and about 2 . 5 to 3 "" in diameter . Prick the surface with a fork a few times ( we do not want the Mathris to puff up while they are being fried ) . Keep aside for frying later . Another way to make the Mathris is to roll out a circle about 4 "" - 5 "" in diameter and then fold in half and fold again into a quarter . Roll out ( and or shape ) all the remaining balls of dough like this . While you are rolling out the Mathris , set up the oil for frying , on a medium heat - you can use a frying pan or a deep fryer . Do not heat the oil too much as the Mathris will cook too fast and will end up being soft and not crisp . Once the Mathris have been rolled out , test the oil to check its temperature . by dropping a tiny ball of the dough into it . If it sizzles and rises quickly to the top , the oil is ready for frying . Now add 6 - 8 of the rolled out Mathris into the hot oil . Do not crowd them or they will not fry well . Fry , gently turning and flipping every now and then , till the Mathris are a pale golden brown in color . When done , use a slotted spoon to drain extra oil and remove the Mathris . Put them on paper towels to drain some more . Allow cooling to room temperature . Serve with a pickle of your choice and a hot cup of Adrak Ki Chai ( ginger tea ) . Mathris can be stored for up to a month , if kept in an airtight container , in a cool , dry place . "
Indian Boondi or Motichoor Laddoo Recipe	1 / 2 kilogram Bengal gram flour|1 / 4 teaspoon baking powder|4 cups water|1 / 2 kilogram sugar|1 1 / 2 teaspoons cardamom powder ( made from green cardamoms )|10 strands saffron ( optional but highly recommended )|3 / 4 cup finely chopped dried cashews ( or almonds , or pistachios )|6 tablespoons milk ( plus extra to mix into the batter )|2 cups ghee for deep frying ( you could use vegetable , canola or sunflower oil but ghee gives tastier results )	Heat your oven for 10 minutes at 150 C / 300 F / Gas Mark 2 and then turn off . Keep the oven shut to contain heat . While the oven is heating , put the 4 cups of water and the sugar in a deep pan and boil . As it boils scum will rise to the top . Skim this off with a metal sieve . The sugar syrup must be boiled until it reaches a one - thread consistency . Once the syrup has reached the one - thread consistency , remove from the fire immediately , add the cardamom powder , stir and place the pan in the previously heated oven to keep the syrup warm . Now put the Bengal gram flour and baking powder in a large bowl and mix well . Add a little milk at a time until you get a thick batter . Whisk to ensure all lumps are removed and the batter is very smooth . Now heat the ghee on a medium flame till hot . Reduce flame a little . Hold the sieve about 4 inches above the hot ghee and fill a ladle with the batter . Pour the batter into the sieve . Now use another spoon to gently press the batter through the sieve and into the ghee . It will fall like tiny drops / beads - Boondi - into the oil ! This is what gives the Laddoos their name ! Press through all the batter you put into the sieve . Now fry the Boondi till they are a very pale golden color . When done , drain , remove and put into a separate bowl . The fried Boondi should be cooked but not crispy . Repeat till all the batter is used up . Once all your Boondi is ready , coarsely crush about 1 / 4 of it with a fork . Add the finely chopped dried nuts , pour the warm syrup over all the Boondi and keep aside for 10 minutes . The Boondi will soak up the sugar syrup and soften . While this is happening warm the 6 tbsps of milk very slightly and then soak the saffron strands in it . After the Boondi has sat in the syrup for 10 minutes , cover in saffron milk ( remove strands before pouring ) over it . Mix well . Grease your hands lightly with some ghee and start forming the syrup - soaked Boondi into walnut - sized ( or slightly larger ) balls ( Laddoo in Hindi ) . Press gently but firmly to bind the Laddoos together . Arrange as you go , on a lightly greased platter . Allow the Laddoos to cool to room temperature before serving . 
Gulgulas ( Indian Banana Fritters ) 	2 overripe bananas ( mashed into a smooth paste )|1 / 2 cup caster sugar|1 teaspoon fennel seeds|1 egg|1 teaspoon vanilla extract|A pinch of cinnamon|1 / 2 to 1 cup of milk ( whole or skim )|1 1 / 2 cups whole wheat flour|1 teaspoon baking powder|Vegetable oil for frying	In a large bowl , mix together the mashed bananas , sugar , fennel seeds , egg , vanilla essence , cinnamon , and milk . Stir to blend everything well , making sure the sugar dissolves completely . Mix together the whole wheat flour and baking powder in a separate bowl . Using a whisk , slowly and a little at a time , add the flour to the wet ingredients . Mix well to ensure there are no lumps or as few as you can manage . You want to end up with a batter that is really thick . You might need a little more flour to achieve this consistency . Heat the cooking oil in a frying pan on medium heat . You will know the oil is heated to the temperature you need to deep - fry the gulgulas when you drop a tiny bit of batter into it and the batter floats up to the surface but does not change color yet . When the oil is ready , use a tablespoon to scoop up and drop a spoonful of batter into the hot oil . Do not overcrowd the pan as the gulgulas will stick to each other and get damaged . Use a slotted spoon to turn the fritters every now and then . Fry until they are golden all over . Then drain using a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper towel to remove most of the oil . Serve while still hot with a steaming cup of masala chai . 
Bhajias ( Pakoras )  - Fried Indian Snack	1 head cauliflower ( or another vegetable of your choice ; potato , spinach leaves , onion , paneer for example )|1 cup Bengal gram flour|1 / 2 teaspoon red chili powder|1 pinch asafetida|1 / 2 teaspoon turmeric|1 teaspoon thymol seeds|salt ( to taste )|vegetable , canola , or sunflower oil ( for deep frying )	"Mix the gram flour and all the spices with a little water at a time , to make a thick batter ( slightly thicker than pancake batter ) .

Easy to Make Dosa ( South Indian Pancakes ) 	3 cups rice|1 cup urad daal ( split , skinless black gram )|3 / 4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds|Salt ( to taste )|Vegetable / canola / sunflower cooking oil	Gather the ingredients . Wash the rice and urad daal well . Add the fenugreek seeds to the mix and fill enough water in the rice - daal bowl to cover them about 2 - inch deep . Soak overnight . The next morning , drain all the water from the rice and urad daal . Now put some in a food processor and grind—adding very little water if necessary—to a smooth yet slightly grainy paste . When all the rice - daal mix is ground like this , put it into a large mixing bowl and add enough water to make a batter . The consistency of the batter should be such that it thickly coats a spoon dipped in it . Now add salt to taste and keep the dosa batter aside in a warm , dark spot , covered , for 6 to 8 hours . After this fermentation , stir the batter well . It is now ready to make dosas . Put some cooking oil in a small bowl and keep ready . You will also need a bowl of ice cold water , a large , flat nonstick pan , 2 sheets of paper towel , a ladle , a spatula , and a basting brush . Fold one sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip lightly into the bowl of cooking oil . Squeeze out any excess and then rub the paper towel all over the surface of the pan to grease . The correct amount of oil is such that it is barely visible in the pan . Now turn on the heat / flame at medium high . Fill the ladle up to the 3 / 4 level with dosa batter . Gently pour this batter onto the center of the pan—just as you would for a pancake—till the ladle is empty . Now begin to spread the batter in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8 - inch diameter . Do not be alarmed if the dosa develops tiny holes as you spread the batter . This is normal . As soon as you have finished spreading the batter out on the pan , dip the basting brush in cooking oil and drizzle the oil all over the surface of the dosa and also around its edges . Now hold the pan by its handle , lift up and swirl it so as to make the drizzled oil spread all over the dosa . When the upper surface begins to look cooked ( it will no longer look soft or runny ) , flip the dosa . By this time , ideally , the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color . Cook for 1 minute after flipping . The dosa is almost done . Fold it in half and allow to cook for 30 seconds more . Before you start making the next dosa , fold another sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip it in ice cold water . Squeeze the wad to remove excess water and then rub it all over the surface of the pan to cool it slightly . This ensures your next dosa will spread evenly and not break because the pan is too hot . Now proceed as you did for the last dosa . Serve the ready dosa with side dishes like South Indian coconut chutney , South Indian gunpowder chutney , and sambar .

Punjabi baingan ka bharta requires that the eggplant is roasted . This can be done in several different ways . The first is to roast it on a gas cooktop by just placing the eggplant straight on the burner and keeping the flame on low setting . Keep turning and cooking until all the skin on the eggplant is charred and the inner flesh looks really soft . A good sign to watch for is that the eggplant seems to ' cave in ' on itself . Or , you can grill the eggplant in your oven broiler or on your barbecue grill . Again , keep turning periodically till all the skin on the eggplant is charred and the inner flesh looks really soft . The third method is to roast the eggplant in your oven till all the skin on the eggplant is charred and the inner flesh looks really soft . Once the eggplant is roasted , allow to cool fully and then peel off and discard the charred skin . Once cool , coarsely mash it and keep aside for later use . Now set up a pan on medium heat and add the cooking oil . When hot , add the cumin seeds and cook till the spluttering stops . Add the onions and fry until soft and translucent . Add the garlic and the ginger and fry for 1 minute . Add the tomato , optional green chilies , and all the powdered spices , including the garam masala . Stir well and cook for 3 to 5 minutes , stirring often to prevent the spice mix from sticking to the pan . Sprinkle a little water if needed . Now add the eggplant and mix well . Add the chopped fresh coriander ( cilantro ) and stir . Cook another minute and turn off the heat . Serve hot with chapatis or rice and your favorite daal dish .

Besan Ki Roti ( Bengal Gram Flour Flatbread ) 	1 cup whole wheat flour|1 cup Bengal Gram flour / Besan|1 cup all - purpose flour|Water ( yogurt or milk yields super soft Besan Ki Rotis )|Dash salt ( or to taste )|2 tbsp . vegetable oil ( or canola / sunflower cooking oil )	"Put all flours and salt into a deep mixing bowl . Stir well to mix them all together . Take out about 5 to 6 tablespoons and set aside on a plate for when you roll out the Rotis . Make a well in the center of the flour in your mixing bowl . Pour a tiny bit of water into the well and begin to mix the flour into it . Go slow with the water and add it only as needed . The idea is to wet the flour only enough to get it to start binding together into a dough . As the dough begins to come together , knead firmly to knock out any lumps . Adding oil at this stage is optional ; it makes for a very smooth dough and soft Besan Ki Rotis . The finished dough must be smooth and medium to soft in consistency . After it is done , cover and set it aside for 10 to 15 minutes to rest . Divide the dough into approximately 18 to 20 equal portions , roughly the size of a golf ball . Roll between your palms , applying gentle pressure , until the balls are smooth and without cracks . Make as many as you need and keep ready to roll out . Lightly flour a smooth , clean , and dry surface using some of the flour you set aside earlier . Coat one ball in this flour . Doing this will prevent the ball from sticking to the rolling surface . Flatten the ball of dough with your fingers to get it ready to roll ! Roll with circular motions till you have a 4 "" circle . Lightly coat the circle on both sides to prevent the dough from sticking as you roll the Besan Ki Roti . The size of the fully rolled Besan Ki Roti should be roughly 6 to 7 inches . This is not a fixed size . The rolled out Besan Ki Roti must not be too thin or it will not puff when roasted , so stop rolling when the Besan Ki Roti has reached 1 / 6 inch thick , no matter what the size . Heat a pan on a medium flame and put the rolled out Besan Ki Roti on it to cook . The Besan Ki Roti is ready for its first flip when you begin to see raised bumps on its surface . Use a spatula to turn it on to its other side . The side that was facing down ( and is now up ) will have light brown spots all over it . Keep checking the other side and do the second flip when it looks similar to the first side . Wait 10 seconds ( approximately ) after the second flip and then use a folded kitchen towel to gently press the Besan Ki Roti around its edges . This will encourage it to puff out . Once puffed up , the Besan Ki Roti is done . Now remove it from the pan and serve immediately or store in a container . The steam that caused the Besan Ki Roti to balloon will release soon after it is removed from the fire , so line the container with a kitchen towel to keep the Besan Ki Roti warm , soft , and free from moisture . Get started on the next one and keep going until you have used up all the dough . "

Continue until all of the lumps are removed and the cheese is absolutely smooth . When this happens the cheese will begin to release its fat and your hands will feel greasy . The success of your rasgulla - making effort depends on how smooth you knead the cheese , so give it your best shot ! Now sprinkle the flour over the surface of the cheese and work it into the cheese to mix thoroughly . Mix the sugar and water in a pressure cooker and bring the mixture to a boil ( without covering the pressure cooker ) . Make sure the cooker is large enough to accommodate the finished rasgullas , as they will expand to double their size while cooking in the syrup . While the sugar syrup boils , divide the dough into small marble - sized balls and roll them between your palms till smooth . Gently add the balls to the sugar syrup . Cover the pressure cooker , add the cooker weight , and wait for the first whistle . Once the first whistle blows , wait another 8 to 10 minutes and then turn off . Release the steam from the pressure cooker and allow the Rasgullas to cool completely before touching them . They will have expanded to almost double their original size and will be delicate when hot . When they are cool , pour the rose water or saffron syrup ( made by soaking the saffron strands in a little warm water ) on the rasgullas . Chill for a few hours before serving . Enjoy !

Sitaphal - Custard Apple Ice Cream Recipe	1 cup fresh sitaphal / custard apple pulp ( seeds removed )|2 egg whites|400 ml thickened / heavy / double cream , chilled|1 / 3 cup sugar ground to a fine powder|1 / 2 tsp vanilla essence	In a deep bowl , mash the custard apple to a coarse pulp using a fork . Now cover with cling wrap and freeze slightly ( not until rock solid ! ! ) . While the Sitaphal is chilling , whisk the 2 egg whites in a clean , dry bowl with a hand beater till they get fluffy and soft peaks are formed in them . The key is to separate the egg white from the yolks very , very carefully . . . even the smallest bit of yolk will prevent the whites from getting fluffy and will impact the light texture of the ice cream greatly . In a separate bowl , whisk the cream , sugar , and essence together . Be careful not to whisk too much as the cream may turn to butter ! This happened to my brother and I a few times so I say it with the voice of experience ! Now add the custard apple pulp to the cream mixture and use a spoon to mix the two together . Gently fold this mixture into the egg whites . . . the idea is to retain as much of the air in the egg whites as possible to get silky , fluffy , light ice cream . Once fully blended , pour into a freezer bowl and cover with cling wrap . Freeze for 3 hours or until firm . Remove from the freezer and whisk again till smooth . Put back in the freezer and leave there till firm again . Scoop out into individual bowls and serve ! 
Jalebi - Indian Celebration Sweet	Batter Ingredients :|2 cups flour ( self - raising )|1 / 2 teaspoon baking powder|1 cup yogurt|3 strands saffron|1 / 4 teaspoon cardamom powder|3 inches vegetable oil ( canola / sunflower cooking oil for deep frying )|2 drops food coloring ( orange )|Syrup Ingredients :|1 cup sugar|2 tablespoons rosewater	Gather the ingredients . Mix the flour , baking powder , yogurt , and food coloring into a batter and keep aside for 24 hours to ferment . Pour batter into a ketchup dispensing bottle . To make sugar syrup , melt the sugar with the rosewater in a small saucepan and boil to get a one thread consistency . To check for one thread consistency , carefully dip the tip of your index finger into the syrup , touch your finger and thumb together and gently tease apart . If one thread is formed between your finger and thumb , the syrup is done . Turn off the fire , add the saffron strands and cardamom and stir well . Heat the oil in a deep wok - like dish . To test for the right temperature , drop a small amount of batter into the oil . If it sizzles and rises to the top of the oil , the oil is hot enough . Keep the flame on medium at all times to ensure thorough cooking of the jalebis . Now hold the ketchup dispenser over the hot oil and squeeze the batter into the oil into a wiggly , randomly coiled circle . Squeeze out several at a time . Fry till light golden and then remove and put directly into the sugar syrup . Allow to soak for 2 to 3 minutes and then remove . Serve warm .

How to Make Panjiri Indian Dessert	1 cup ghee|1 / 4 cup gond / gaund ( edible gum crystals )|1 / 4 cup makhana ( puffed lotus seeds )|1 / 2 cup wholemeal flour ( atta )|1 / 2 cup coarse semolina ( sooji )|1 cup sugar ( ground coarsely )|1 cup unsalted almonds ( dry roasted and ground to a coarse powder )|1 tablespoon ginger powder ( optional )|1 teaspoon carom seed powder ( optional )|1 teaspoon cardamom powder ( optional )|1 teaspoon fennel seed powder ( optional )	Heat the ghee in a deep pan or wok , on a medium heat . Add the gond crystals and fry , stirring constantly to prevent burning . The crystals will puff up . Remove with a slotted spoon and keep aside on a paper towel . In the same ghee , fry the makhana till pale golden in color . Remove with a slotted spoon and keep aside on a paper towel . Grind the gond and makhana ( separately ) to coarse powders , in a clean , dry coffee grinder . In the same ghee as above , add the wholemeal flour and semolina . Stir continuously and cook till the mixture is pale golden in color and looks like damp sand . This takes patience . Do not be tempted to raise the cooking temperature as this will only cause the mixture to burn . When the flour and semolina are fully roasted , add all the other ingredients ( including the fried and ground gond and makhana ) . Mix well and turn off the heat . Allow the Panjiri to cool to room temperature before serving . If serving to a new mother , Panjiri is usually given with a glass of warm full cream / whole milk . 
Indian Cham - Cham Dessert With Lemon Juice and Saffron	2 liters full cream / whole milk|2 to 3 tbsps lime / lemon juice|5 tsp flour|4 cups water|2 cups sugar|2 - 3 tbsps rose water or a few strands of saffron|5 drops of yellow food color ( according to your preference )	Gather the ingredients . Bring the milk to a boil over a medium flame . Stir occasionally to sure the milk does not burn . When the milk begins to boil , add the lime juice and mix well . When the curds begin to separate from the milk , turn off the fire and leave the milk aside for 10 minutes to let the curdling process finish . Strain the cheese and wash it well under running water - to remove all the lime juice from it . Now put the cheese in a cheesecloth and hang for 1 hour to completely drain all the liquid from it . Put the drained cheese into a mixing bowl and begin to knead it . Continue till all the lumps are removed and the cheese is absolutely smooth . When this happens the cheese will begin to release its fat and your hands will feel greasy . The smoother you knead the cheese , the better the Cham - Chams . This is the time to add the yellow food color and mix well . Now sprinkle the flour over the surface of the cheese and work it into the cheese to mix thoroughly . Mix the sugar and water in a pressure cooker and bring the mixture to a boil ( without covering the pressure cooker ) . Make sure the cooker is large enough to accommodate the finished Cham - Chams , as they will expand to double their size while cooking in the syrup ! While the sugar syrup boils , divide the dough into small marble - sized balls and roll between your palms till smooth . Now gently press them into an oblong shape and then flatten a little . Gently add the balls to the sugar syrup and cover the pressure cooker . Add the cooker weight and wait for the first whistle . Once the first whistle blows , wait another 8 to 10 minutes and then turn off the fire . Release the steam from the pressure cooker and allow the Cham - Chams to cool completely before touching them . They will have expanded to almost double their original size and will be delicate when hot . When cool , pour the rose water or saffron syrup ( made by soaking the saffron strands in a little warm water ) on the Cham - Chams and chill for a few hours . When chilled , remove the Cham - Chams from the syrup and arrange on a platter . Whisk the fresh cream until thick and fluffy . Fill into an icing bag and pipe a swirl out ( with a thick nozzle ) onto each Cham - Cham . Garnish with slivers of your favorite dried fruit and serve .

You will know the oil is heated to the temperature you need to deep - fry the gulgulas when you drop a tiny bit of batter into it and the batter floats up to the surface but does not change color yet . When the oil is ready , use a tablespoon to scoop up and drop a spoonful of batter into the hot oil . Do not overcrowd the pan as the gulgulas will stick to each other and get damaged . Use a slotted spoon to turn the fritters every now and then . Fry until they are golden all over . Then drain using a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper towel to remove most of the oil . Serve while still hot with a steaming cup of masala chai .

Indian Boondi or Motichoor Laddoo Recipe	1 / 2 kilogram Bengal gram flour|1 / 4 teaspoon baking powder|4 cups water|1 / 2 kilogram sugar|1 1 / 2 teaspoons cardamom powder ( made from green cardamoms )|10 strands saffron ( optional but highly recommended )|3 / 4 cup finely chopped dried cashews ( or almonds , or pistachios )|6 tablespoons milk ( plus extra to mix into the batter )|2 cups ghee for deep frying ( you could use vegetable , canola or sunflower oil but ghee gives tastier results )	Heat your oven for 10 minutes at 150 C / 300 F / Gas Mark 2 and then turn off . Keep the oven shut to contain heat . While the oven is heating , put the 4 cups of water and the sugar in a deep pan and boil . As it boils scum will rise to the top . Skim this off with a metal sieve . The sugar syrup must be boiled until it reaches a one - thread consistency . Once the syrup has reached the one - thread consistency , remove from the fire immediately , add the cardamom powder , stir and place the pan in the previously heated oven to keep the syrup warm . Now put the Bengal gram flour and baking powder in a large bowl and mix well . Add a little milk at a time until you get a thick batter . Whisk to ensure all lumps are removed and the batter is very smooth . Now heat the ghee on a medium flame till hot . Reduce flame a little . Hold the sieve about 4 inches above the hot ghee and fill a ladle with the batter . Pour the batter into the sieve . Now use another spoon to gently press the batter through the sieve and into the ghee . It will fall like tiny drops / beads - Boondi - into the oil ! This is what gives the Laddoos their name ! Press through all the batter you put into the sieve . Now fry the Boondi till they are a very pale golden color . When done , drain , remove and put into a separate bowl . The fried Boondi should be cooked but not crispy . Repeat till all the batter is used up . Once all your Boondi is ready , coarsely crush about 1 / 4 of it with a fork . Add the finely chopped dried nuts , pour the warm syrup over all the Boondi and keep aside for 10 minutes . The Boondi will soak up the sugar syrup and soften . While this is happening warm the 6 tbsps of milk very slightly and then soak the saffron strands in it . After the Boondi has sat in the syrup for 10 minutes , cover in saffron milk ( remove strands before pouring ) over it . Mix well . Grease your hands lightly with some ghee and start forming the syrup - soaked Boondi into walnut - sized ( or slightly larger ) balls ( Laddoo in Hindi ) . Press gently but firmly to bind the Laddoos together . Arrange as you go , on a lightly greased platter . Allow the Laddoos to cool to room temperature before serving .

Shakkarpara - Shakkarpare - Shakarpali	1 / 2 cup ghee|1 / 2 cup milk|1 / 2 cup sugar|3 cups all - purpose flour|2 tablespoons coarse semolina|Pinch of salt|Oil for deep frying ( vegetable , sunflower , or canola )	Put the ghee and milk in a small pan set over low heat . Cook until the ghee is melted . Remove the pan from the heat and stir the ghee - milk mixture well . Pour the ghee - milk mixture into a deep mixing bowl or a shallow , wide mixing platter . While the ghee - milk mixture is still hot , add the sugar and stir until all the sugar dissolves completely .  ( The heat will help dissolve the sugar faster . ) Once the sugar has dissolved , set the mixture aside to cool completely . In a bowl , combine the flour , semolina , and salt . Once the ghee mixture has cooled , add the flour mixture , a little at a time , stirring after each addition . Use clean hands to knead the mixture into a smooth , medium - firm dough . The dough should not be sticky . Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and set it aside to rest for 30 minutes . Unwrap the dough and knead it again until it is soft and pliable . Divide the dough into 6 equal - sized balls . Roll each ball between your palms until it is smooth and free of cracks . Lightly flour a clean work surface and use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a round circle about 1 / 3 - inch thick . Do not worry if the circle has cracked edges . Use a knife or rotary pizza cutter to cut the circle into strips that are 1 - inch wide . Cut again to turn these strips into diamond shapes . Remove the edge pieces that are very small or have cracked edges . Do not discard , as they can be reused later to make more shakkarpara . Repeat with the rest of the dough balls . As you keep cutting out the diamond shapes , keep them on a plate lined with paper towel . While you are cutting out your shapes , heat the cooking oil in a deep wok , pan , or deep fryer . When all your shapes are ready and the oil is hot , add small batches of the cut dough into the hot oil and fry until golden on both sides , stirring often using a slotted spoon . When done , remove from the oil with the slotted spoon and drain on paper towels . Do this until all the pieces are fried . Allow the fried shakkarpara to cool completely and then store in an airtight container in a cool , dry place .

I find this is usually unnecessary as the Rasgullas would have imparted some of their sweetness to the dessert , so I prefer not to add extra sugar . That is , however , a matter of personal choice . Turn off the heat now and spoon the dessert very gently into a serving dish . Keep aside to cool completely . While the dessert is cooling , put the almonds in a microwave - safe bowl and add enough water just to cover them . Cook on High for 1 minute . Remove from microwave and allow to sit for 2 minutes . Now take each almond and squeeze between thumb and forefinger . The skin will slip off easily . Discard the skin . Do this for all the almonds and then cut into slivers . Decorate your dessert with these almond slivers . Chill the Rabdi - Rasgulla in the refrigerator until ready to serve . 
Badam Almond Halwa Indian Dessert Recipe	3 1 / 2 cups almonds ( whole )|Water ( hot , enough to soak almonds in )|1 1 / 2 cup milk|5 tablespoons ghee ( divided )|3 cups sugar|Optional : 1 / 2 teaspoon saffron strands ( recommended )|Optional : a few drops of yellow food coloring|1 / 2 teaspoon cardamom powder	Gather the ingredients . Put the almonds in a deep bowl and add enough hot water to them to cover them . Leave them to soak for 3 to 4 hours . Once the almonds have soaked , remove their skins . To do this press each almond between a thumb and forefinger and slide your thumb forward . This will make the almond slip out of its skin . Do this for all the almonds . Discard the skins . Put the skinless almonds into a blender and add the milk to them . Blend the mixture to form a coarse paste ( the same consistency as sooji / rawa ) . Set up a deep , heavy - bottomed pan on medium heat . When it is hot , add 3 tablespoons of ghee to it . When the ghee melts , add the almond - milk mixture to it . Stir well . Now add the sugar to the mixture and stir to mix well . Add the saffron strands and mix well . Cook the mixture over medium heat , constantly stirring to prevent it from scorching or burning . It can happen very easily , so be extra careful . Stir constantly .  ( At one stage , as the liquid in the mixture begins to dry up , it will bubble and splash , so be very careful while stirring the mixture as droplets can burn you badly . It might help to wear an oven glove / mitt to protect your hand from the splatters during this stage . ) Once the splattering stops ( a sign that the Halwa is almost done ) , add the remaining ghee and the food coloring and stir well . Keep cooking the mixture until most of the moisture in it dries up . It will start to come away from the sides of the pan now , and you will also see a small amount of the ghee begins to separate from it . You will know the Halwa is ready when it no longer sticks to the pan at all . In fact , when you look at the bottom of the pan , it will be clean . Take the Halwa off the heat and spoon it onto a flat platter or plate to cool . Serve warm or at room temperature in bowls , garnished with a pinch of thin almond slivers ! Enjoy ! 
Making Sugar Syrup For Indian Desserts	2 cups sugar|1 cup water|1 / 2 cup milk	Mix the sugar and water in a heavy - bottomed pan and set up to boil , on a medium flame . When the sugar is all dissolved , add the milk to the syrup ( the milk causes any impurities to surface and be removed ) and allow to boil some more . A scum will be formed on the surface . Remove this by skimming the syrup with a spoon or straining it through a metal sieve . Put back to boil . Keep testing the syrup to check its consistency . To do this dip a wooden spatula in the syrup and lift out . Allow cooling for a few seconds as it will be very hot at first . Now touch the syrup with a clean forefinger and then touch your thumb and forefinger together and pull apart gently . Keep boiling the syrup gently till you reach the consistency called for in the recipe . Stages progress fairly quickly after a point , so check frequently . Half - thread consistency is when a single thread is formed and breaks immediately when your forefinger and your thumb are pulled apart gently . One - thread consistency is when a single thread is formed ( and does not break ) when your forefinger and your thumb are pulled apart gently . Two - thread consistency is when two threads are formed ( and do not break ) when your forefinger and your thumb are pulled apart gently . This stage is also called the soft ball stage - when a drop of syrup of this consistency is dropped into a bowl of cold water , it forms a soft ball . Three - thread consistency is when three threads are formed ( and do not break ) when your forefinger and your thumb are pulled apart gently . This stage is also called the hard ball stage - when a drop of syrup of this consistency is dropped into a bowl of cold water , it forms a hard ball . 
Kulkuls ( Indian Christmas Sweet Curls ) 	1 pound / 1 / 2 kg all - purpose flour|1 / 2 teaspoon baking powder|1 tablespoon cold butter ( cubed )|2 large eggs|1 / 4 cup powdered sugar|1 cup coconut milk|2 quarts oil ( or enough for deep - frying )|1 cup granulated sugar|3 to 4 tablespoons water	Gather the ingredients . In a bowl , mix the flour and baking powder well . Add the butter a little at a time , mixing gently until the butter is pea - sized . Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add them to the flour - butter mix . Add the powdered sugar and coconut milk and mix into a soft dough . Form the dough into small sized balls . Grease the back of a fork with some oil . Flatten the ball of dough and press it onto the back of the fork , forming a rectangle the length of the back of the fork tines . Starting at the bottom end of the fork , roll the dough up the tines and off the fork and into a tight curl . The end result will be a tube - like curl with the ridges from the fork on it . Place the curl on a plate and work the remaining dough similarly until it is all used up . Heat the oil in a deep , heavy - bottomed pan over medium heat . When hot , fry the kulkuls , making sure to turn them often until they are a light golden brown color . Drain and cool on paper towels . Put the granulated sugar and water in a separate pan and cook until the sugar is fully melted and a syrup forms . Add the cooled kulkuls to the sugar syrup and coat well . Remove and allow the curls to sit on a plate until the sugar is encrusted on the kulkuls . When fully cooled , you can store the kulkuls for a considerable amount of time if kept in an air - tight container . Enjoy ! 
Chana Daal Halwa - Bengal Gram Halwa	2 cups Chana Daal / Bengal Gram ( split yellow lentils )|2 cups ghee|1 cup sugar|2 cups water|6 pods green cardamom split|1 cup Khoya|1 / 2 cup of full cream milk powder|1 cup finely chopped mixed dried fruits of your choice ( optional but desirable )	Gather the ingredients . Wash the Chana Daal in a sieve under running water until the water runs clear . Put into a deep bowl . Now add enough water to the daal so it is just covered . Leave to soak overnight . The next morning , drain all the water away and grind the soaked daal to a smooth paste in a food processor . Do not add any water while grinding . Prepare a sugar syrup of one - thread consistency - here ' s how you do it . When done , turn off the fire and add the split cardamom pods to the syrup . Cover and keep aside to use later . Heat the ghee in a heavy - bottomed ( preferably non - stick ) pan on a medium flame till warm . Add the Chana Daal paste to this ghee and stir to mix . Cook the Chana Daal , stirring frequently till it begins to turn golden and release its aroma ( signs that it is ' done ' ) . This could take from 10 to 20 minutes to happen . While it may seem like hard work , the result is well worth the effort ! Another sign of done - ness to watch for is the separation of the ghee from the Chana Daal . When the daal looks ready ( as described above ) , add the Khoya and full cream milk powder now and stir to blend well . Cook for another 2 - 3 minutes . Now add the previously prepared sugar syrup ( remove cardamom pods before adding ) and stir to blend . Cook on a medium heat for 5 - 7 minutes , stirring frequently .
